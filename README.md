On osTicket (support ticket system), I was assigned to prepare a computer with Microsoft Windows 11 and Ubuntu Linux to be installed in dual boot configuration. I uploaded a PDF of the ticket to show my skills in the following:

- Operating System Installation: Initialized a new SSD and installed both Windows 11 and Ubuntu using a Ventoy bootable drive (pp. 2, 22).

- Windows Customization: Configured advanced system settings via Local Group Policy, Registry Editor, and Local Security Policy to disable automatic updates, ads, and Microsoft account prompts (pp. 6-8).

- User & Network Management: Created administrative and standard user accounts following strict password guidelines, assigned a static IP address, and configured Windows Firewall rules (pp. 13-14, 16, 21).

- Software Deployment: Installed a suite of engineering and productivity applications on both OS platforms, including Blender, FreeCAD, and LibreOffice, utilizing UNC file shares for Windows and the apt package manager for Ubuntu (pp. 17, 24-25).

- System Maintenance: Created a custom Microsoft Management Console (MMC) for hardware and disk management and verified all configurations through a series of twelve documented tasks (pp. 14-15, 25).
